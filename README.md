> A WiFi Meat Thermometer for the ESP8266

I barbecue a lot.  But getting the meat to *just* the right temperature always stresses me out, and I'm prone to checking it way too often.

Why drop $50 to $100 on a Bluetooth-enabled meat thermometer when you can make something arguably better for *pennies on the dollar*?!

Actually, I just wanted to see if I could do it myself.

So here's this, which uses WiFi for connectivity and [Blynk](http://blynk.cc) for an interface.

The stuff is in the box.  Trust me!

## Components

- [WeMos D1 Mini](http://www.wemos.cc/wiki/doku.php?id=en:d1_mini): This is basically a smaller [NodeMCU dev board](http://nodemcu.com/index_en.html#fr_54747661d775ef1a3600009e).
- K-type thermocouple probe, such as [this](http://www.amazon.com/Probe-Thermocouple-Sensor-Temperature-Controller/dp/B00899A4LY/)
- [MAX6675](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/analog/sensors-and-sensor-interface/MAX6675.html)-based breakout board, such as [this](http://www.electrodragon.com/product/max6675-breakout-board-for-thermocouple-genius-ic/)
- USB cable for power (to be used with USB wall adapter or whatever)
- Some watertight enclosure
- Assortment of M/F, M/M or F/F Dupont cables depending on your board's headers.  I soldered female headers to the top of my D1 mini.
- (Optional) DHT22 ([datasheet](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Temperature/DHT22.pdf)) breakout such as [this](http://www.play-zone.ch/en/dht22-am2302-digitaler-temperatur-und-feuchtigskeitssensor-breakout.html) for ambient temp and relative humidity
- (Optional) An itty-bitty breadboard such as [this](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2463) if necessary; the D1 Mini only has one exposed GND header

## Build

Wire it up and stuff it in the enclosure (see `src/main.cpp` for pin mappings).  Oh, yeah--drill some holes first.

I'm unsure if the pins are 5V tolerant or not; there is a 5V output on the D1 Mini, but I'm scared to use it, so I connected both breakouts to 3.3V.

## Blynk

Go get [Blynk](http://blynk.cc) for your phone and make a Blynk app.  This sketch uses virtual ports 7 and 8 for the main display and graph; it also uses virtual ports 0 and 1 for ambient temp and relative humidity, respectively.

Can you share Blynk apps?  I don't know.

## Installation

1.  Clone this repo.

2.  Install [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org) if you haven't already:

  ```shell
  $ pip install platformio
  ```

3.  Modify `src/meat.h` with your credentials.  There's probably a better way to do this, but I am stupid about these things.

4.  Modify `platformio.ini` with any tweaks.  I've built this for a WeMos D1 Mini, but it will likely work on other boards.  If you can add support for another board, please send it my way!

5.  To build, execute:

  ```
  $ platformio run
  ```

6.  To upload the sketch, plugin your device via USB (sorry, no OTA) and:

  ```
  $ platformio run --target upload
  ```

## Notes

`src/main.cpp` is an Arduino sketch.  See PlatformIO's docs for instructions on how to use this with various different IDEs; I used CLion.
